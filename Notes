Thinks I recognized:
->  Frame timing, used for animations, is currently hard coded, and this seams a little bit odd, since the time management is based in the time between frames.
    A better solution may be to couple this to the delta time of the game loop.
->  Better way to distinguish between movement and idle. This is something I recognized when I added the debug marker
    (theres currently now proper way to switch between an idle and a movement animation)
->  Texture arrangements: There is currently now mechanism which allows to group textures. For example:
    It's currently not possible to draw the object and a line of sight and/or a circle around it...

Open question:
->  Should I stop at this point, and take everything I learned to start from scratch?
    Note: I somehow managed to overcome problems, whenever I thinking of giving up. On the one side this is something good, but on the other side it doesn't feel right.
->  If yes, should I change to another library?
    Note: I was thinking about stopping here an switching to a 3D engine, but I'm still not sure since I invested a lot of time into this project.
    But on the other side I sometime encounter problems where I think: It my be better if I take everything I learned so far and start with a fresh mind, since I now know this is going to be a lot bigger.
    So yes, to this question. I think if I start anew I will switch to another library aswell.
    I think I will stick with the name, since I somehow like it.
