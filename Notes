Thinks I recognized:
->  Frame timing, used for animations, is currently hard coded, and this seams a little bit odd, since the time management is based in the time between frames.
    A better solution may be to couple this to the delta time of the game loop.
->  Better way to distinguish between movement and idle. This is something I recognized when I added the debug marker
    (theres currently now proper way to switch between an idle and a movement animation)
->  Texture arrangements: There is currently now mechanism which allows to group textures. For example:
    It's currently not possible to draw the object and a line of sight and/or a circle around it...

Open question:
->  Should I stop at this point, and take everything I learned to start from scratch?
->  If yes, should I change to another library?
